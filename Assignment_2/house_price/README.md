# Assignment 02 — Application 2: House-Price Prediction

**Intelligent System Development · From Data Representation to a Deployable Intelligent System**
Lecturer: Dinh Que Tran, Ph.D., Assoc. Prof. · Semester I.2026

This is the **house-price** application — Application 2 of the Assignment 02 submission.
It follows the official spec (`slide_assign/intel_sys_dev_assignment_02_final.pdf`):
Appendix A repository layout, Appendix B 23-section notebook, Appendix C `POST /predict`.

Parent folder `Assignment_2/` is the Assignment 02 repo and also holds `diabetes/` and
`customer_behavior/` (Applications 1 and 3), plus `report/` — see `../README.md`.

## Pipeline

```
Data → Understand → Clean → Represent → Learn → Evaluate → Persist → Deploy (Web + Mobile)
```

This is a **regression** task: `X` = property attributes, `y` = listing price
(million VND). It differs from the diabetes classification app in target type
(continuous, not class), loss (error-based), and metrics (MAE / MSE / RMSE / R²,
no confusion matrix).

## Dataset

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Name | VN Real Estate Listings (April–September 2025) |
| File | `data/VN-real-estate-Apr-Sept-2025.csv` — 236,226 rows × 28 cols, ~210 MB |
| Encoding | UTF-8 **with BOM** (`encoding="utf-8-sig"`), separator `,` |
| Target | `Price`, in **million VND** ("2.7 tỷ" ↔ `Price` = 2700) |

Full column roles and the data-quality issues (corrupted `Price`/`Area`, 72–84% missing
`Bedrooms`/`Bathrooms`/`Floors`, constant `VIP Account`, `Title` leaks the target) are in
[`data/README.md`](data/README.md).

An earlier version used the ~30k-row Kaggle `vietnam_housing_dataset.csv`; it and its
trained artifacts were removed when the dataset was switched to this larger scrape.

## Reproduce

### 1. Environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate     # Python 3.14 (see notebook §0)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`RANDOM_SEED = 42` throughout. Exact library versions are printed in notebook section 0.

### 2. Data

```bash
cp ../../VN-real-estate-Apr-Sept-2025.csv data/       # if not already present
```

### 3. Notebook

Open `notebook/house_price.ipynb` and **Run All**. It runs the full pipeline
(load → clean → represent → 5 regression models → evaluate on the held-out test set →
persist) and writes `model/model_pipeline.joblib`, `model/feature_names.joblib` and
`model/input_schema.json`. Section 23 reloads the artifact from disk and turns one raw
input dict into a JSON prediction — the contract the API depends on.

### 4. API

```bash
# from Assignment_2/house_price/
uvicorn api.main:app --reload --port 8001
# Swagger UI: http://localhost:8001/docs
```

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8001/predict -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"Area": 78.7, "Bedrooms": 3, "Bathrooms": 2, "Floors": 2, "Property Type": "Nhà riêng", "Province": "an-giang", "district": "Rạch Giá"}'
# -> { "predicted_price": <million VND>, "price_per_m2": ..., "model_name": "..." }
```

See [`api/README.md`](api/README.md) for the full endpoint list and request shape.
For **Postman**, import `api/house_price_api.postman_collection.json` (set the `{{baseUrl}}`
variable, then run the requests).

### 5. Web

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:5173
```

> The `web/` and `mobile/` clients were built against an earlier Node backend
> (`/api/predict`, camelCase payload, `/api/meta`, SHAP endpoints). They need rewiring
> to the FastAPI `POST /predict` above, or compatibility routes added to `api/`. Tracked
> in `web/README.md`.

### 6. Mobile

```bash
cd mobile
npm install
npx cap sync
npx cap run android      # or: open ios/App/App.xcworkspace
```

Point the client at the API host (`web/.env` / the mobile config). Training happens only
in the notebook; the mobile app is a REST client of the deployed model
(**Training ≠ Inference**).

## Deliverable checklist (Appendix F, house-price rows)

- [ ] Kaggle dataset selected and referenced (`data/README.md`)
- [ ] Problem definition, dataset structure, data quality analysed (notebook §1–§9)
- [ ] Data representation explained — raw row → feature vector, `X ∈ ℝ^{N×d}`, `y ∈ ℝ^N` (§12)
- [ ] Numerical + categorical features identified, encoding + scaling explained (§11–§13)
- [ ] EDA with ≥3 interpreted plots (§10)
- [ ] Train/val/test split, leakage discussed (§14)
- [ ] Preprocessing pipeline fitted on train only (§15)
- [ ] ≥4 regression models trained + compared: MAE / MSE / RMSE / R² + training time (§16–§18)
- [ ] Best model evaluated on held-out test set (§19), error analysis (§20), selection justified (§21)
- [ ] `model_pipeline.joblib` (+ schema) saved (§22); reload → JSON inference test (§23)
- [ ] REST API `POST /predict` working, demonstrated via Swagger / curl
- [ ] Web app: input form → prediction, screenshots
- [ ] Mobile app: input → prediction, screenshots, evidence of API calls
- [ ] Reproducibility: Python version, OS, `requirements.txt`, `RANDOM_SEED`
